# Plant Monitoring System ðŸŒ±

The **Plant Monitoring System** is an IoT-based project designed to monitor and manage the environment for plants in real time. It leverages **AWS IoT**, cloud storage, and other AWS services to ensure a smart and efficient system. This project includes hardware integration, a cloud-based backend, and a user-friendly GUI to display data, control settings, and manage notifications.

## Features

- **IoT Integration**: Real-time monitoring of environmental parameters using sensors connected to AWS IoT.
- **AWS Services**: Data is processed and stored using AWS IoT Core, DynamoDB, and MQTT Broker.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays sensor data using graphs and charts for better insights.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Sends notifications when conditions like soil moisture or temperature exceed thresholds.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Provides an intuitive interface for monitoring and controlling the system.
